This repo was created by completing the 'HTML & CSS IS HARD' web development tutorials from internetingishard.com. All of the uploaded code was hand-typed out by me; there was no copy/pasting from the source material. I chose to omit the CSS Float and Web Typography tutorials and read through those lessons instead in order to learn the main concepts. I wrote the code in Atom.io while reading through the tutorial and additional resources (e.g. MDN Web Docs, Stack Overflow, etc.) in Google Chrome. I opened the html files that I wrote in Chrome as well.. refreshing the page when I saved work in Atom. I pushed my work to GitHub using Git Bash and Mac Terminal... This README file was created in the CLI :)
