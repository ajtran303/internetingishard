    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1> <!-- common for first <h1> to match the <title> -->
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <!-- There are 6 levels of headings, the higher the number, the lesser the prominence -->

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <!-- These elements provide semantic / structural information about the content. Its appearance in the browser can be altered by CSS later, so <em> and <strong> may not always be italic and bold. -->

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br/> <!-- optional trailing slash for ease of reading self closing element-->
      The Authors</p>

    <hr/> <!-- Horizontal Rule - less significance than new heading, more significance than new paragraph -->
    <!-- In this example <hr/> is used as a thematic break between the closing valediction and the postscript -->

    <p>P.S. This page might look not great, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
